Subjects to voting are instructions costs, computational cost limit, block size limit,
and the block version. Voting for the block version lasts for 16 epochs, and requires
90 percent of the miners to vote for the change.

All other kinds of voting are organized in the following way. A miner who
successfully generates the first block in the epoch initiates the voting over one
of the parameters, stating explicitly whether a value of the parameter should be
decreased~(except the case when the current value is below $min\_step$) or increased from miner's
point of view.

The value of the change is predefined as $\max(\lceil0.01 \times current\_value\rceil, min\_step)$ with $min\_step$
being the hard-coded value. The voting lasts for one epoch. Every miner
submitting the block during this epoch has two options: accept or reject the
proposal. Miner's vote must be written in the generated block. Change in the
value requires the majority of votes over the epoch. Every block contains the
vote of the miner who generated it. In case the proposal fails, the parameters
remain unchanged.
