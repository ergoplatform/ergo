  /**
    * This code shows how to do a client checking a Merkle-tree based membership proof against an
    * incomplete header (so header without a proof-of-work solution). This could be useful for a
    * decentralized pool with collaterals, where the pool checks shares from miners, and a share
    * includes proof that a corresponding block contains a certain transaction (paying to the pool).
    *
    * For example, a working scheme for a decentralized pool could be as follows:
    *   1. A miner is creating a transaction which is paying to the pool
    *     (posting of the tx by the pool outside the block should be impossible)
    *   2. The miner is creating block candidate with the tx included (via calling "mining/candidateWithTxs").
    *     The result would be like the following:
    *       {
    *         "msg" : "6cb37d0a202bc2984f43de003cbc5558804db45798d0fc8faae7390b96d42d15",
    *         "b" : 748014723576678314041035877227113663879264849498014394977645987,
    *         "pk" : "0278011ec0cf5feb92d61adb51dcb75876627ace6fd9446ab4cabc5313ab7b39a7",
    *         "proof" : {
    *           "msgPreimage" : "01fb9e35f8a73c128b73e8fde5c108228060d68f11a69359ee0fb9bfd84e7ecde6d19957ccbbe75b075b3baf1cac6126b6e80b5770258f4cec29fbde92337faeec74c851610658a40f5ae74aa3a4babd5751bd827a6ccc1fe069468ef487cb90a8c452f6f90ab0b6c818f19b5d17befd85de199d533893a359eb25e7804c8b5d7514d784c8e0e52dabae6e89a9d6ed9c84388b228e7cdee09462488c636a87931d656eb8b40f82a507008ccacbee05000000",
    *           "txProofs" : [{
    *             "leaf" : "642c15c62553edd8fd9af9a6f754f3c7a6c03faacd0c9b9d5b7d11052c6c6fe8",
    *             "levels" : [
    *               "0139b79af823a92aa72ced2c6d9e7f7f4687de5b5af7fab0ad205d3e54bda3f3ae"
    *             ]
    *           }]
    *         }
    *       }
    *   3. The miner is mining the block using "msg", "b", "pk" as it happens now. If block is found, the miner is
    *   posting the transaction to the network. However, if real difficulty of the solution is not enough to form a
    *   block but enough for a share, then the miner can post the share to the pool. The share consists of "msg", "b",
    *   "pk", solution and the "proof".
    *
    *   4. The pool checks that the share is valid. In particular, the pool checks that:
    *     a) the "msgPreimage" (which is a header without a PoW solution) along with the PoW form a valid header
    *     with enough difficulty
    *     b) the header contains transaction by using "proof"
    *
    *   The code below is about step 4b only.
