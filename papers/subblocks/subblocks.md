Motivation
----------

Currently, a block is generated every two minutes on average, and confirmed transactions are propagated along with 
other block sections. 

This is not efficient at all. Most of new block's transactions are already available in a node's mempool, and 
bottlenecking network bandwidth after two minutes of (more or less) idle state is also downgrading network performance.

Also, while average block delay in Ergo is 2 minutes, variance is high, and often a user may wait 10 minutes for 
first confirmation. Proposals to lower variance are introducing experimental and controversial changes in consensus protocol.
Changing block delay via hardfork would have a lot of harsh consequences (e.g. many contracts relying on current block 
delay would be broken). Thus it makes sense to consider weaker notions of confirmation which still could be useful for 
a variety of applications. 

Sub-Blocks
----------

A valid block is sequence of (semantically valid) header fields (and corresponding valid block sections, such as block 
transactions), including special field to iterate over, called nonce, such as *H(b) < T*, where *H()* is Autolykos Proof-of-Work
function, *b* are block bytes (including nonce), and *T* is a Proof-of-Work *target* value. A value which is reverse 
to target is called difficulty *D*: *D = 2^256 / T* (in fact, slightly less value than 2^256 is taken, namely, order of 
secp256k1 curve group, this is inherited from initial Autolykos 1 Proof-of-Work algorithm). *D* (and so *T*) is being readjusted 
regularly via a deterministic procedure (called difficulty readjustment algorithm) to have blocks coming every two minutes on average. 

Aside of blocks, *superblocks" are also used in the Ergo protocol, for building NiPoPoWs on top of them. A superblock is
a block which is more difficult to find than an ordinary, for example, for a (level-1) superblock *S* we may require 
*H(S) < T/2*, and in general, we can call n-level superblock a block *S* for which *H(S) < T/2^n*. Please note that a
superblock is also a valid block (every superblock is passing block PoW test).

Similarly, we can go in opposite direction and use *subblocks*, so blocks with lower difficulty. We can set *t = T/64*
and define superblock *s* as *H(s) < t*, then miner can generate on average 64 subblocks (including normal block itself)
per block generation period. Please note that, unlike superblocks, subblocks are not blocks, but a block is passing 
subblock check.

Subblocks are similar to block shares already used in pooled mining. Rather, this proposal is considering to use 
sub-blocks for improving transactions propagation and providing a framework for weaker confirmations.

Sub-Blocks And Transactions Propagation
---------------------------------------

Let's consider that new block is just generated. Miners A and B (among others) are working on a new block. Users are
submitting new unconfirmed transactions at the same time to the p2p network, and eventually they are reaching miners 
(including A and B, but at a given time a transaction could be in one of the mempools just, not necessarily both, it 
could also be somewhere else and not known to both A and B).

Then, for example, miner A is generating a sub-block committing to new transactions after last block. It sends sub-block
header as well as weak transaction ids (6 bytes hashes) of transactions included into this sub-block but not previous 
sub-blocks to peers. Peers then are asking for transactions they do not know only, and if previous sub-block is not 
known, they are downloading it along with its transactions delta, and go further recursively if needed. 

Thus pulse of sub-blocks will allow to exchange transactions quickly. And when a new sub-block is also a block (passing 
normal difficulty check), not many transactions to download, normally. Thus instead of exchanging all the full-block 
transactions when a new block comes, peers will exchange relatively small transaction deltas all the time. Full-block 
transactions sections exchange still will be supported, to support downloading historical blocks, and also old clients. 

Sub-blocks Structure and Commitment to Sub-Blocks
-------------------------------------------------

Here we consider what kind of footprint sub-blocks would have in consensus-enforced data structures (i.e. on-chain). 
Proper balance here is critical and hard to achieve. Strict consensus-enforced commitments (when all the 
sub-blocks committed on-chain) require from all the miners to have all the sub-blocks in order to check them. But, 
at the same time, consensus-enforced commitments to properly ordered sub-blocks would allow for protocols and 
applications using sub-blocks data.

We have chosen weak commitments. That is, a miner may (and incentivized to) to commit to longest sub-blocks chain 
since previous full-block, but that there are no any requirements about that in Ergo consensus rules.

New extension key space starting with 0x03 will be used for sub-blocks related data, with one key used per this EIP:

0x03 0x00 - digest of a Merkle tree of longest sub-blocks chain starting with previous block (but not including it).

So first sub-block having full-block as a parent will have empty tree, next one will have only first, and next 
full-block will commit to all the sub-blocks since previous full-block. 

Note that sub-blocks (like blocks) are forming direct acyclic graph (DAG), but only longest sub-blocks chain is 
committed.

At the same time, no any new checks are planned for the Ergo protocol. Checks are possible for sidechains. 


Sub-Block Based Sidechains
--------------------------

As L1 incentivization for propagating and committing on-chain to sub-blocks are missed, we consider sub-block based 
merge-mined sidechains as possible option to incentivize miners to participate in the sub-blocks sub-protocol. They 
also can be used to enforce linearity (so that transactions added in a previous sub-block can't be reversed). 

A merged-mined sidechain is using sub-blocks as well as blocks to update its state which can be committed via main-chain 
transactions even. That is, in every sub-blocks side-chain state (sidechain UTXO set digest etc) can be written in a box 
with sidechain NFT, and then every sub-block the box may be updated. 

For rewarding miners submitting sub-blocks to Ergo network (sidechain block generators are listening to), a sidechain block
may be consist of main-chain sub-block and sidechain state along with membership proof. For enforcing linearity of transactions
, sidechain consensus may enforce rollback to a sub-block before transaction reversal on proof of reversal being published. 

Incentivization
---------------

No incentives to generate and propagate sub-blocks are planned for the Ergo core protocols at the moment. At the same 
time, incentives can be provided on the sub-block based merge-mined sidechains, or via application-specific agreements
(where applications may pay to miners for faster confirmations).


Weak Confirmations
------------------

With linearity of transactions history in sub-blocks chain, sub-blocks may be used for getting faster confirmations 
with weaker security guarantees.
