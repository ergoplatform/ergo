/**
  * The `RequestModifier` message requests one or more modifiers from another node.
  * The objects are requested by an inventory, which the requesting node
  * typically received previously by way of an `Inv` message.
  *
  * This message cannot be used to request arbitrary data, such as historic transactions no
  * longer in the memory pool. Full nodes may not even be able to provide older blocks if
  * theyâ€™ve pruned old transactions from their block database.
  * For this reason, the `RequestModifier` message should usually only be used to request
  * data from a node which previously advertised it had that data by sending an `Inv` message.
