Token emission is incorporated with just value one preservation law added, in addition to the standard one~(that is,
sum of monetary values for transaction inputs should be equal to the corresponding sum for outputs). One output can
hold tokens of multiple kinds, the maximum number of tokens per output is 4~(in addition to the main Ergo token).
They are stored in the register R3 as a sequence of $\{token\_id: amount\}$ tuples. This is the only kind of data
which can be stored in R3.  The emission is organized as appending an item to
the dictionary. To avoid collisions, appended $token\_id$ must be equal to the
$id$ of the first input of the generating transaction. The uniqueness of outputs
yields the uniqueness of tokens. Obviously, only an output can contain a new asset, and a transaction
may create no more than one new asset.

 The validation script is then
\begin{eqnarray*}
    &\forall\,id\in \left\{ i\, | \exists\, out \in outputs : i\in out.R3.keys
    \right\} \nonumber\\
    &\left(\sum_{in\in inputs} in.R3[id] = \sum_{out\in
    outputs} out.R3[id] \right) \vee \left(id = inputs[0].id\right)\,.
\end{eqnarray*}
Here $\sum$ stands for the safe sum, which ensures non-negativeness of all the
values, and the absence of integer overflows on the way. The controlled emission of the
tokens may be organized by attaching the emission script to the output which contains newly generated $token\_id$.
