        We present Ergo, a new flexible blockchain protocol.
        Ergo is designed for writing decentralized applications with the main focus of providing an efficient, secure and easy way to implement financial contracts.

        To achieve this goal, Ergo includes various technical and economic improvements to existing
        blockchain solutions. Every coin in Ergo is protected by a program in ErgoScript, which is
        a powerful and protocol-friendly scripting language based on $\Sigma$-protocols.
        Using ErgoScript, we can encode the conditions under which coins may be used: who can spend them,
        when, under what external conditions, to whom, and so on.

        Extended support for light nodes makes Ergo friendly for end users because it allows running 
        contracts on untrusted commodity hardware.
        To be usable in the long-term, Ergo follows a survivability approach -- it uses
        widely-researched solutions that don't result in security issues in the future,
        while also preventing performance degradation over time with the new economic model.
        Finally, Ergo has a self-amendable protocol that allows it to absorb new ideas and
        improve itself in the future.
