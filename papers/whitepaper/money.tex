    \label{sec:contractual}

 In our opinion, the overwhelming majority of use-cases for a public blockchains (even those that claim to provide a general-purpose decentealized world computer) are for financial applications, which do not require Turing-completeness. For instance, if an oracle writes down non-financial data into the blockchain~(such as temperature), this data is usually used further in a financial
 contract. Another trivial observation we make is that many applications use digital tokens with mechanics different from the native token.

For an application developer, the Ergo Platform offers custom tokens~(which are first-class citizens) and a domain-specific language for writing box protecting
 conditions in order to implement flexible and secure financial applications.
 Ergo applications are defined in terms of protecting scripts built into boxes, which may also contain data involved in the execution.
 We use the term {\em contractual money} to define Ergs (and secondary tokens) whose usage is bounded by a contract. This applies to all tokens on the platform in existance because any box with its contents~(Ergs, tokens, data) is bounded by a contract.
 
 However, we can distinguish between two types of contractual Ergs. The first, called {\em free Ergs}, are the ones that could change their contracts easily and have no restrictions on the outputs of a spending transaction. The other, called {\em bounded Ergs}, are bounded by contracts which demand the spending transaction to create boxes with specific properties. 
 
 For example, if a box $A$ is protected by just a public key~(so providing a signature against a spending transaction is enough in order to destroy the box), the public key owner can spend $A$ and transfer the Ergs to any arbitrary output box. Thus, the Ergs within $A$ are free. 
% to change the contract. 
In contrast, imagine a box $B$ protected by combination of a public key and a condition that demands the spending transaction to create an output box with the same amount of Ergs as in $B$ and whose guarding script has the hash \texttt{rBMUEMuPQUx3GzgFZSsHmLMBouLabNZ4HcERm4N} (in Base58 encoding). In this case, the Ergs in $B$ are bounded Ergs.
 
 Similarly, we can define free and bounded tokens. An Ergo contract can have can have several hybrids such as bounded Ergs and free tokens or both bounded under one public key and free under another. 

\subsection{Prelimiaries For Ergo Contracts}

  While in Bitcoin, a transaction output is protected by a program in a stack-based language named {\em Script}, in Ergo a box is protected by a logic formula which combines predicates over a context with cryptographic statements provable via zero-knowledge protocols using AND, OR, and $k$-out-of-$n$ connectives. The formula is represented as a typed direct
 acyclic graph, whose serialized form is written in a box. To destroy a box, a spending transaction needs to provide arguments (which include zero-knowledge proofs) satisfying the formula.

 However, in most cases, a developer is unlikely to develop contracts in terms of graphs. Instead, he would like to use a high-level language such as ErgoScript, which we provide with the reference client. 
 
 Writing scripts in ErgoScript is easy. As an
 example, for a one-out-of-two signature, the protecting script would be ${pk_1 \|pk_2}$, which means ``prove knowledge of
 a secret key corresponding to the public key $pk_1$ or knowledge of a secret key corresponding to public key $pk_2$''. We have
 two separate documents for help in developing contracts with ErgoScript: the ``ErgoScript Tutorial''~\cite{ergoTutorial}
 and the ``Advanced ErgoScript Tutorial''~\cite{ergoAdvTutorial}. Thus, we do not get into the details of developing contracts with ErgoScript. Rather, we are provide a couple of motivating examples in the following sections.

Two more features of Ergo shaping contracting possibilities are:

 \begin{itemize}
    \item {\em Data Inputs: }
 To be used in a transaction, a box need not be destroyed but can instead be read-only. In the latter case, we refer to the box as being part of the {\em data input} of the transaction. Thus, a transaction gets two box sets as its arguments, the inputs and
 data inputs, and produces one box set named {\em outputs}. Data inputs are useful for oracle applications and interacting contracts.

    \item {\em Custom tokens: }
 A transaction can carry many tokens as long as the estimated complexity for processing them does not exceed a limit. A transaction can also issue a single token with a unique identifier which is equal to identifier of a first~(spendable) input box of the transaction. The identifier is unique assuming the collision resistance of an underlying hash function. 
 The amount of the tokens issued could be any number within the range $[1, 9223372036854775807]$. The weak preservation rule is followed for tokens, which requires that the total amount of any token in a transaction's outputs should be no more
 than total amount of that token in the transaction's inputs~(i.e., some amount of token could be burnt). In contrast, the strong reservation rule is followed for Ergs, which requires that the total amount of Ergs in the inputs and outputs must be same.
 \end{itemize}

\subsection{Contract Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

 In this section we provide some examples which are clearly show superiority of Ergo contracts in comparison with
 Bitcoin. The examples are including a bet on oracle-provided data, non-interactive mixing, atomic swap,
 complementary currency, and initial coin offering implemented on top of the Ergo blockchain.

 \subsubsection{An Oracle Example}
 \label{sec:platform}

 Equipped with custom tokens and data inputs, we can develop a simple oracle example, also showing on the way some
 design patterns that we have discovered while playing with Ergo contracts. Assume that Alice and Bob are going to bet
 on weather tomorrow. For that, they are putting money into a box, which is spendable by
 Alice if the temperature is more than 15 degrees, and is spendable by Bob otherwise. To deliver the temperature into the
 blockchain a trusted oracle is needed.

 In opposite to Ethereum with its long-lived accounts, where trusted oracle identifier is usually known in advance,
 delivering data with one-time boxes is more tricky. For starters, a box which is protected by an oracle's key could
 not be trusted, as anyone can create such a box. It is possible to include a signed data into a box, and check the
 signature in the contract using the data, we have such an example, but this example is quite involved. With custom
 tokens, however, a solution is pretty simple.

 In the first place, a token identifying the oracle should be issued. In the simplest case, the amount for the token could
 be equal to one. We call such a token {\em a singleton token}. Then the oracle is creating a box containing the token
 and also data, namely, temperature in the register number four~($R4$), and time~(in seconds since the beginning of
 the UNIX epoch) in the register number five($R5$).
 In order to update temperature, an oracle is destroying the box and creating a new one with updated temperature.

 Assume that Alice and Bob know oracle's token identifier in advance. With this knowledge, they
 can jointly create a box which requires first data input (which is read-only) to contain the oracle's token. The
 contract is extracting temperature and time from the data input
 and decides who is getting the payout. The code is as simple as following:

 \begin{algorithm}[H]
    \caption{Oracle Contract Example}
    \label{alg:oracle}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \State val dataInput = CONTEXT.dataInputs(0)
        \State val inReg = dataInput.R4[Long].get
        \State val inTime = dataInput.R5[Long].get
        \State val inToken = dataInput.tokens(0).\_1 == tokenId
        \State val okContractLogic = (inTime $>$ 1556089223) \&\&
        \State\hspace{\algorithmicindent}\hspace{\algorithmicindent} ((inReg $>$ 15L \&\& pkA) $||$ (inReg $\le$ 15L \&\& pkB))
        \State inToken \&\& okContractLogic
    \end{algorithmic}
 \end{algorithm}

 This contract shows how a singleton token could be used for authentification. As a possible alternative, an oracle
 can put signed time and temperature into a box along with a signature for the data published. However, this requires
 signature checking in a contract which is using an oracle box, which is more complex and expensive, in comparison with
 the singleton token approach. Also the contract shows how read-only data inputs could be useful for contracts which do
 need access to data in some box in the state. Without data inputs, an oracle needs to issue a spendable box for every
 pair of Alice and Bob. With data inputs support, the oracle is issuing only a single box per arbitrary number of users.

\subsubsection{A Mixing Example}
 \label{sec:platform}

 Privacy is important for a digital currency, but implementing it in a protocol could be costly or require a trusted
 setup. Thus we are looking for ways to do coin mixing via cheap enough applications. As a first step towards that, we
 offer an application for non-interactive coin mixing, which is working in the following case:
 \begin{enumerate}
    \item{} Alice creates a box which demands any Bob's box to satisfy certain conditions in order to be mixed with
    the coin of Alice. After that, Alice only listens to the blockchain, no any interaction with Bob is needed.
    \item{} Bob is creating a box and then a spending transaction which has boxes of Alice and Bob as inputs,
     and creates two outputs with the same script, but both Alice and Bob may spend only one box out of the two.
     An external observer can not decide which output is spent by whom, as output boxes are indistinguishable.
 \end{enumerate}

 For simplicity, we are not considering fees in the example. The idea of mixing is similar to non-interactive
 Diffie-Hellman key exchange. First, Alice creates a secret value $x$~(a huge number) and publishing a corresponding
 public value $gX = g^x$. She demands from Bob to generate a secret number $y$, and to include into each output two
 values $c1$, $c2$, where one value is equal to $g^y$ and another is equal to $g^{x \cdot y}$. We assume that a Bob is using
 a random coin to choose meanings for $\{c_1, c_2\}$. With no access to the secret information, an external
 observer can not guess whether, for example, $c_1$ is about $g^y$ or $g^{x \cdot y}$, with probability above
 $\frac{1}{2}$ (as a cryptographic primitive we are using has a certain property, namely, the hardness of
 Diffie-Hellman decisional problem). To destroy an output box, a proof should be given that for $c_2$ whether $y$ is known,
  such that $c_2 = g^y$, or $c_2 = g^{x \cdot y}$ has the same exponent $x$ against $c1 = g^y$ as $g^x$ against $g$.
 The contract of the Alice's box is checking that $c1$ and $c2$ are well-formed. The code snippets for the Alice's coin and
 a mixing transaction output are provided in Algorithm \ref{alg:alice} and Algorithm \ref{alg:mixing-out}, respectively.

 \begin{algorithm}[H]
    \caption{Alice's Input Script}
    \label{alg:alice}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \State val c1 = OUTPUTS(0).R4[GroupElement].get
        \State val c2 = OUTPUTS(0).R5[GroupElement].get
        \State
        \State OUTPUTS.size == 2 \&\&
        \State OUTPUTS(0).value == SELF.value \&\&
        \State OUTPUTS(1).value == SELF.value \&\&
        \State blake2b256(OUTPUTS(0).propositionBytes) == fullMixScriptHash \&\&
        \State blake2b256(OUTPUTS(1).propositionBytes) == fullMixScriptHash \&\&
        \State OUTPUTS(1).R4[GroupElement].get == c2 \&\&
        \State OUTPUTS(1).R5[GroupElement].get == c1 \&\& \{
        \State\hspace{\algorithmicindent}  proveDHTuple(g, gX, c1, c2) $||$
        \State\hspace{\algorithmicindent}  proveDHTuple(g, gX, c2, c1)
        \State \}
    \end{algorithmic}
 \end{algorithm}

 \begin{algorithm}[H]
    \caption{Mixing Transaction Output Script}
    \label{alg:mixing-out}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \State val c1 = SELF.R4[GroupElement].get
        \State val c2 = SELF.R5[GroupElement].get
        \State proveDlog(c2) $||$            // either c2 is $g^y$
        \State proveDHTuple(g, c1, gX, c2) // or c2 is $u^y = g^{x \cdot y}$
    \end{algorithmic}
 \end{algorithm}

 We refer to the \cite{ergoAdvTutorial} for a proof of outputs indistinguishability and details on why
 Alice and Bob can spend only their respective coins.


\subsubsection{More Examples}

 In this section we are briefly shedding a light on few more examples along with links to documents providing
 details and code.

\paragraph{Atomic Swap}

Cross-chain atomic swap Ergo and another blockchain~(supporting a payment to SHA-256 or Blake2b-256 hash preimage
and a time-lock) could be done in the same way as proposed for Bitcoin, see initial protocol for Bitcoin in
\cite{Nol13}, its Ergo alternative is provided in~\cite{ergoTutorial}. As Ergo has custom tokens,
atomic exchange on a single block chain (Erg-to-token or token-to-token) is also possible, a solution for that can be
found~\cite{ergoTutorial}.

\paragraph{Crowdfunding}

 We consider a simplest crowdfunding scenario. In the example, a crowdfunding project with a known public key
 is considered successful if it
 can collect unspent outputs with total value not less than a certain amount before
 a certain height. A project backer creates an output box protected by the following statement: the box can be spent
 if a spending transaction is having its first output box protected by the project's key, and the output should have
 no less than the target amount.
 Then the project can collect biggest backer output boxes with total value not less
 than the amount with a single transaction~(it is possible to collect up to ~22,000 outputs in Bitcoin, which is
 enough even for a big crowdfunding campaign). For remaining small outputs over the amount, it is possible to
 construct follow-up transactions. The code can be found in~\cite{ergoTutorial}.

\paragraph{The Local Exchange Trading System}

 Here we briefly overview a local exchange trading system implementation. In such a system, a member of a community may
 issue community currency via personal debt. For example, if Alice with zero balance is buying something for $5$
 community tokens from Bob, which balance is about zero as well, her balance after the trade would be $-5$ tokens, and
 Bob's balance would be $5$ tokens. Then Bob can buy something for his $5$ tokens, for example, from Carol.
 Usually, in such systems, there is a limit for negative balance (to avoid free-riding).

 As digital community could be vulnerable to sybil attacks~(which allow to do free-riding again), thus some mechanism
 is needed in order to prevent the creation of sybils creating debts. We consider two solutions, namely, a committee of
 trusted managers approving new members of the community, or security deposits made in Ergs. For simplicity, we
 consider the approach with the committee here.

 This example is about two interacting contracts then. A management contract is about maintaining a
 community members list, and a new member could be added if management condition satisfied  (for example, a threshold
 signature is provided). A new member is associated with a box which contains a token identifying the member. The user
 box is protected by a special exchange script requiring to do a fair exchange only for a spending transaction.
 We skip the corresponding code, but it could be found in a separate article~\cite{icoTutorial}.

 What this contract shows, in comparison with previous example, is that instead of storing a members list, only a short
 digest of an authenticated AVL+ tree is to be included into a box. That allows to reduce storage requirements for the
 state. A transaction which is doing lookup or modification of the member list should provide a proof for AVL+ tree
 lookup or modification operations. Thus saving space in the state storage leads to bigger transactions, but the latter
 problem for scalability is easier to solve.


\paragraph{Initial Coin Offering}

 An initial coin offering (ICO) example shows very clearly how to develop a multi-stage contract in Ergo. Like most of
 ICOs, our example is about three stages. In the first stage the project is raising money in Ergs. In the second stage,
 the project is issuing a new token, with amount of tokens to be equal to an amount of nanoErgs raised in the stage. In
 the third stage, investors can withdraw issued tokens.

 Note that the first stage could be about many transactions on
 the blockchain, as well as the third stage, while for the second stage a single transaction is enough. As in the
 previous example, an ICO contract box will contain a list of investors, now stored along with investments.


\paragraph{Even More Examples}

 We have more examples of Ergo applications, such as time-controlled emission, cold wallet, rock-paper-scissors game,
 and so on. The examples could be found in \cite{ergoTutorial, ergoAdvTutorial}.
